In order to relieve the pressure on healthcare, reducing mpMRI scan time is necessary. This review focuses on recent techniques proposed for faster mpMRI acquisition, specifically shortening T2W and DWI sequences while adhering to the PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) guidelines. Speeding up techniques in the reviewed studies rely on more efficient sampling of data, ranging from the acquisition of fewer averages or b-values to adjustment of the pulse sequence. Novel acquisition methods based on undersampling techniques are often followed by suitable reconstruction methods typically incorporating synthetic priori information. These reconstruction methods often use artificial intelligence for various tasks such as denoising, artifact correction, improvement of image quality, and in the case of DWI, for the generation of synthetic high b-value images or apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Reduction of mpMRI scan time is possible, but it is crucial to maintain diagnostic quality, confirmed through radiological evaluation, to integrate the proposed methods into the standard mpMRI protocol. Additionally, before clinical integration, prospective studies are recommended to validate undersampling techniques to avoid potentially inaccurate results demonstrated by retrospective analysis. This review provides an overview of recently proposed techniques, discussing their implementation, advantages, disadvantages, and diagnostic performance according to PI-RADS guidelines compared to conventional methods.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
