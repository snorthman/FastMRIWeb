We investigated training nnU-Net models with Cross-Entropy (CE), Focal loss (FL), CE+FL, and CE+Dice loss and compared them with nnDetection, which is designed for medical object detection. For csPCa detection, we used 3050 exams with PI-RADS â‰¥ 4 annotations for training. Trained models were evaluated on 97 Gleason grade group â‰¥ 2 lesions in 300 exams from an external center. For pancreatic cancer detection, we used 242 exams for training. Trained models were evaluated on 281 histopathology-confirmed lesions in 361 exams from two publicly available, external, datasets. We performed extensive experimentation, with 10 to 20 runs per configuration, totaling about 6000 GPU hours.
