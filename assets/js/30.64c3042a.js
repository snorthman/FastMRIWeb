All studies were evaluated by experienced radiologists during clinical routine. The findings in 2,659 studies were manually segmented. We propose a hybrid framework to augment our detection model with more training data. After training with expert csPCa segmentations, we generate automatic cancer segmentations by masking our model predictions with the number of csPCa lesions automatically extracted from radiology reports. An augmented detection model is then trained jointly on manual and automatically generated csPCa segmentations. Models trained on expert or augmented cancer segmentations are evaluated on 296 visits of 296 consecutive men with elevated PSA or clinical suspicion of prostate cancer from an independent, external, centre. Ground truth is provided by MR-guided and TRUS-guided biopsies, and radical prostatectomy when available. Studies are considered positive if they have at least one Gleason grade group â‰¥ 2 lesion (csPCa).
