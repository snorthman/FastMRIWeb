The trained algorithm was used to predict 561 unseen cases from Institute B (Philips scanner) and 200 unseen cases from Institute C (Siemens scanner). The variability in patient-level likelihood scores was used to measure prediction uncertainty. Predictions with a low variability were considered certain whereas predictions with a high variability were considered uncertain, at risk of AI failure. Multiple splits (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) were used to make certain and uncertain groups. The ability of AI to triage patients was assessed by comparing the AUROC of certain cases with uncertain cases.
