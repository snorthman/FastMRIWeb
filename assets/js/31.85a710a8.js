Experts interpret diagnostic images in clinical routine and write their findings in reports. Leveraging unlabelled examinations paired with clinical reports could overcome the manual annotation bottleneck. We hypothesise that detection models can be trained semi-supervised with annotations generated using model predictions, guided by sparse information from clinical reports. We developed a semi-supervised training method for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection in biparametric MRI (bpMRI). We included 7,756 prostate MRI examinations and evaluated csPCa detection performance on 300 examinations from an external centre with histopathology-confirmed ground truth.
