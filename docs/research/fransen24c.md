## ðŸ“– Abstract
*Purpose*: To explore diagnostic deep learning for optimizing the prostate MRI protocol by assessing the diagnostic efficacy of MRI sequences.

*Materials and Methods*: This retrospective study included 840 patients with a biparametric prostate MRI scan. The MRI protocol included a T2-weighted image, three DWI sequences (b50, b400, and b800 s/mm2), a calculated ADC map, and a calculated b1400 sequence. Two accelerated MRI protocols were simulated, using only two acquired b-values to calculate the ADC and b1400. Deep learning models were trained to detect prostate cancer lesions on accelerated and full protocols. The diagnostic performances of the protocols were compared on the patient-level with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), using DeLong's test, and on the lesion-level with the partial area under the free response operating characteristic (pAUFROC), using a permutation test. Validation of the results was performed among expert radiologists.
 
*Results*: No significant differences in diagnostic performance were found between the accelerated protocols and the full bpMRI baseline. Omitting b800 reduced 53% DWI scan time, with a performance difference of + 0.01 AUROC (p = 0.20) and âˆ’0.03 pAUFROC (p = 0.45). Omitting b400 reduced 32% DWI scan time, with a performance difference of âˆ’0.01 AUROC (p = 0.65) and + 0.01 pAUFROC (p = 0.73). Multiple expert radiologists underlined the findings.

*Conclusion*: This study shows that deep learning can assess the diagnostic efficacy of MRI sequences by comparing prostate MRI protocols on diagnostic accuracy. Omitting either the b400 or the b800 DWI sequence can optimize the prostate MRI protocol by reducing scan time without compromising diagnostic quality.
